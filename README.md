## A simple and affordable earthquake detector

<br>

**Brief description of the project**:

We constructed an earthquake detector that can accurately detect earthquakes from affordable equipment, such as gyroscopes and accelerometers. Our core detector and visualization code are written in C (Arduino) and Java (Processing) respectively, while the circuit is designed using Fritzing. These data are stored digitally and analyzed in real-time, which can then be visualized with our graph visualization software. If specific parameters from the analysis are satisfied, the detector will automatically alert people in the surroundings by sounding an alarm. Details about the background, implementation, and cost can be found in the technical report.
